Privacy Policy

Last Updated: August 15, 2025

Welcome to our publication! We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how our website operates. This policy outlines how we use cookies and other technologies on this site.

This website does not collect, store, or process any personal data. The information collected is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.

1. How We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to the site's owner.

A. Functional and Necessary Cookies

We use functional cookies to provide you with a consistent and user-friendly experience. These cookies are essential for the website to function as you expect.

Theme Preference Cookie: To provide a smooth user experience and prevent a "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC), a cookie is used to remember your theme preference (e.g., light or dark mode). This allows the website to render the correct theme on the server-side (SSR) before the page loads. This cookie does not contain any personal data and is used solely to store your chosen visual preference. You can opt out of this cookie by setting your theme preference to "auto," which will use your system's default theme instead.

B. A/B Testing and Experience Optimization

ABContext Widget Cookie: This publication features an interactive "ABContext" widget that allows us to test different content styles and user experiences. This widget lets you choose which experiences are more pleasant based on your interactions. To ensure you have a consistent experience throughout your visit, a temporary, non-persistent cookie is used. This cookie contains a randomly generated, anonymous alias that helps the widget remember which content styling to display for the duration of your session. This cookie is not used to track you across different visits or websites. It is automatically deleted when you close your browser. The data collected is completely anonymous and aggregated, and cannot be used to identify you.

2. Your Choices and Controls
Because our website does not collect any personal data, you do not need to take any action to protect your privacy. The cookies used are strictly for site functionality and anonymous experience optimization.

You can, however, manage your theme preference directly on the website. Additionally, you can always control and delete cookies through your web browser settings. Please refer to your browser's help menu for more information on how to do this.

3. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology or best practices. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
